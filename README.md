# 🧠 Fake Faces Detector

A deep learning-based project to detect fake human faces (e.g. deepfakes) using Convolutional Neural Networks and a pre-trained ResNet-50 model. This project focuses on minimizing fraud risk by reliably classifying AI-generated human faces.

# 📌 Objective
To develop a predictive model capable of identifying fake human faces generated by AI (such as StyleGAN2) and distinguish them from real ones, with a strong focus on high recall in detecting fake faces to reduce potential fraud.

# ⚙️ Models Used

🔹 **Model A: Custom CNN**
Built using Keras Sequential API

5 Convolutional Layers + MaxPooling

3 Dense Layers (including Softmax output layer)

Achieved recall of 0.71 for the 'fake' class

🔹 **Model B: Pre-trained ResNet-50**
Uses ResNet-50 with ImageNet weights

Fine-tuned for binary classification (real vs. fake)

Achieved recall of 0.99 for the 'fake' class

Selected for final inference phase

# 📊 Evaluation Metrics

| Model               | Recall (Fake Class) |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Model A (CNN)       | 0.71                |
| Model B (ResNet-50) | 0.99 ✅              |

A high recall score is prioritized to ensure fake faces are not misclassified as real.

# 🧪 Inference Results
A final test was performed on 10 unseen images (5 real + 5 fake):

| Class | Correct Predictions |
| ----- | ------------------- |
| Fake  | 5 / 5 ✅             |
| Real  | 1 / 5 ⚠️            |

Despite lower performance on real faces, **Model B successfully detects nearly all fake faces**, making it highly suitable for fraud prevention use cases.
